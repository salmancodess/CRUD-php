The following steps are need for installation

1. XAMPP is a free and open-source cross-platform web server solution stack package developed by Apache Friends,consisting mainly of the Apache HTTP Server, MariaDB database, and interpreters for scripts written in the PHP and Perl programming languages.Since most actual web server deployments use the same components as XAMPP, it makes transitioning from a local test server to a live server possible.
2. MySQLi Extension (MySQL Improved) is a relational database driver used in the PHP scripting language to provide an interface with MySQL protocol compatible databases (MariaDB, MySQL, Percona Server, TiDB).
3. vs code Editors.
